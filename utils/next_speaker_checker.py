Analyze the conversation and determine who should speak next: 'user' or the 'model'.

Rules:
1. If the model just completed a task and is waiting for the user's next request, answer 'user'.
2. If the model is in the middle of a multi-step task (e.g., it used a tool and needs to process the result), answer 'model'.
3. If the model made tool calls but hasn't provided a final response about the results, answer 'model'.
4. If the conversation is at a natural stopping point, answer 'user'.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON object by calling the `determine_next_speaker` function with the correct arguments.
